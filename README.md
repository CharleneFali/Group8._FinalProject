Streamlit App
The streamlit_app.py file contains the code for a Streamlit web application. Users can input movie reviews, and the sentiment analysis model predicts whether the review is positive or negative.
Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are implemented using scikit-learn. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance model accuracy.
Deep Learning Model
A deep learning model using LSTM layers is implemented with TensorFlow and Keras for more complex sentiment analysis.
Data Preprocessing
Text data is preprocessed by removing stop words, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing words using NLTK. The dataset is balanced by combining positive and negative samples.
Model Training
The machine learning models are trained on the IMDb dataset. Grid search is utilized for hyperparameter tuning.
Model Deployment
The best Logistic Regression model is saved along with the CountVectorizer for deployment. A deep learning model is saved as an H5 file.
Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports.
Usage Example
A simple example code demonstrates how to load the models during deployment and make predictions on new data.
Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn

How to Run
1.	Mount Google Drive using the provided Colab code.
2.	Execute the Streamlit app: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Enter a movie review in the app, click "Predict," and view the sentiment prediction.
